# Carousel-demo
A basic carousel for demo purposes without using external libraries.

## How to run:
Clone this repository and run `node index.js` and go to `localhost:3000`.  
Or just open `/public/index.html` in your browser and it should work.

Possible improvements:
* Animations could be added to the slide
* Add automatic slider
* Make carousel.js libary more generic

Please see comments in the code for explanation about the solution.
